IMS for a Store

Project Overview

In this project, I created an Inventory Management System (IMS) for a retail store using Python classes. The system allows the store to handle products, keep track of stock, record sales, and generate reports. This project helped me apply object-oriented programming principles to solve real-world inventory management challenges.

 Implemented Functionalities

 1. Product Class

Attributes:
  - Name
  - Category
  - Price
  - Quantity in stock
  - Unique product identifier

 2. Inventory Class

Methods:
  - Add products
  - Update stock levels
  - Retrieve product information

 3. Sales and Transactions

Transaction Class:
  - Represents individual sales
  - Includes products sold, quantities, and total amount

 4. Stock Management

Methods:
Update stock levels for purchases and restocking

  - Accurate tracking of stock levels

 5. Reports

Generated Reports:
  - Current stock levels
  - Sales history
  - Revenue reports

6. User Interface
- Type: Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Functionality:
 - User-friendly interaction for managing products, sales, and generating reports

 Expected Skills Gained

- Object-Oriented Programming and Class Design:
  - Effective use of classes and objects to model real-world entities.

- Data Storage and Retrieval:
  - Efficient methods for storing and retrieving product and sales data.

- User Interface Development:
  - Development of a user-friendly CLI for seamless interaction.

- Real-World Application Experience:
  - Practical implementation of inventory management principles.

Test Results

 Functionality 1: Product Class

- Test Result: Passed
- The Product class successfully captures product details and attributes.

 Functionality 2: Inventory Class

- Test Result:Passed
- The Inventory class effectively manages product data, allowing addition, retrieval, and stock level updates.

 functionality 3: transaction class
 -The transaction class successfully shows what transaction was made.
 
 Discussion on Project Result

In this project, the Inventory Management System effectively handles the store's inventory. By sticking to object-oriented programming principles, the system is modular and scalable, making it suitable for different store needs.

I thoroughly tested the system, and all features worked as intended. The user interface is user-friendly, allowing store managers to keep an eye on stock levels, manage sales, and generate useful reports without hassle.
